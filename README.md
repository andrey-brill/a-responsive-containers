### Idea

Using responsive pixel/containers instead of @media queries

### npm
```
import { ResponsiveContainers } from 'responsive-containers';
let responsiveContainers = new ResponsiveContainers();
...
```

### self-host/cdn
```
<script src="build/index.js"></script>

let { ResponsiveContainers } = window.ResponsiveContainers;
let responsiveContainers = new ResponsiveContainers();
...
```
